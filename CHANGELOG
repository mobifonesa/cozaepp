Version 0.0.3
 *Removed dependency on epp gem from rubygems.org since it lacks SSL features (see README for installing SSL-capable gem)

Version 0.0.2
 * Added SSL functionality (required by the production EPP service)
   Depends on an SSL-patched version of the EPP gem which can be found at https://github.com/tgenov/epp

 Version 0.0.1
 * Initial version (built while testing accreditation against the test EPP environment)
 * Supports all EPP messages documented by the registry, but a lot of the return data can be cleaned up.
